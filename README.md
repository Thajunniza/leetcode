## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to problems on LeetCode ([https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)). The solutions are implemented with a focus on efficiency, readability, and best practices, with a strong emphasis on Python. Each problem's solution is provided as a file, along with a README detailing the approach. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills and build a collection of well-documented code.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- A Python file (`.py`) containing the solution (e.g., `TwoSum.py`).
- A README file (`README.md`) explaining the problem, the solution approach, and time/space complexity analysis.

## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git:** You'll need Git to clone the repository. If you don't have it, download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).
- **Python:** Version 3.6 or higher is required.  Download it from [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/).

bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-solutions.git
    cd leetcode-solutions
    1.  Navigate to the directory containing the solution you want to examine (e.g., `Problem1_TwoSum`).

2.  Each solution is contained within a Python file (`.py`) named descriptively (e.g., `TwoSum.py`). The corresponding `README.md` file provides context, explanation, and complexity analysis.

bash
    python TwoSum.py
    1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your solution: `git checkout -b feature/ProblemName`.
3.  Implement your solution in a Python file (`ProblemName.py`).
4.  Add a `README.md` to the problem directory explaining the problem and your solution, including time and space complexity analysis.
5.  Ensure your code follows the project's style guidelines (e.g., naming conventions, comments). Use `flake8` or `pylint` for Python code.
6.  Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add solution for ProblemName"`.
7.  Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/ProblemName`.
8.  Create a pull request.
